This data jam will introduce Tableau Desktop through hands-on tutorials and activities organized by Cedric Wacker from Devoteam Data Driven (formerly Inviso)

Tableau Desktop is a popular commercial visualization tool sold by Tableau Software, which allows people to use easily and quickly create standard charts and maps, for example, through drag and drop interaction. The company was founded by Christian Chabot, Pat Hanrahan and Chris Stolte, who were researchers at the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University. They specialized in visualization techniques for exploring and analyzing relational databases and data cubes, and started the company as a commercial outlet for research at Stanford from 1999 to 2002. Thus, Tableau is often mentioned as a commercial success story of data visualization research.

For our activity, Cedric will cover material from their Tableau 1 training. While this usually takes four hours and comprises a mix of demos and hands-on activities, he will speed things up a little, and introduce the most important areas. Cedric invites general questions afterwards.

### Schedule 

We loosely follow this plan. While we are usually open to drop-ins as time permits, the tutorial is planned in a way that makes it most useful to attend from the beginning.  

| 16.00 | Arrival and introduction to the tutorial 
| 16.10 | Introduction to Tableau 
| 16.20 | Connect to data 
| 16.30 | Basic visualisations 
| 17.00 | Filtering, dates and maps 
| 17.30 | Dashboard
| 17.45 | Recap 

It's very likely that there won't be time to actually develop a dashboard but we will definitely demo some good examples. 

### Expectations

Keeping with the jam narrative, we aim for this event to be fun and engaging, and to allow us to meet fellow people with interests related to human data interaction.

* Have fun 
* Bring your own laptop 
* Discuss perspectives related to human data interaction and beyond
