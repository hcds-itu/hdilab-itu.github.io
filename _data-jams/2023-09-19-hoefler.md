üéâ Join us for the second Data Jam of the semester at the Human Data Interaction Lab! üìÖ

We're thrilled to continue our series of Data Jams. In this installment, we present a screening of the documentary 'Typeface design - Jonathan Hoefler' featuring the renowned typeface designer Jonathan Hoefler and his groundbreaking work at his typeface design studio. üñãÔ∏è

The documentary episode, which was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award, constitutes the sixth and final part of the Netflix documentary series 'Abstract: The Art of Design'. The documentary dives into the fascinating phenomena that shape our modern alphabets while following the development of a new typeface from start to finish.

After the screening, there will be a short exercise related to typeface design to put the content of the documentary into practice.
