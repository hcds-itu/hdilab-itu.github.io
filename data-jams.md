# Data Jams are back in 2025!

Our Data Jams will be back in the 2025 autumn semester.
Data Jams are weekly informal events intended to bring people together to discuss aspects relating to human data interaction and to attempt to better understand what this notion is.

Keeping with the jam narrative, we aim for this event to be fun and engaging, and to allow us to meet fellow people with interests related to human data interaction.

First and foremost, we aim to have fun while doing hands-on activities and discussing perspectives related to human data interaction, and perhaps beyond:)
