ðŸ“šðŸ¤“ Starting October 30th (W44), we're introducing our weekly TA (Teaching Assistant) hours at the HDI Lab.

Where: 4D Wing (by office 4D22)

These sessions are designed to offer students dedicated support and guidance. Whether you require assistance with programming, project development, or simply want to discuss your latest HDI ideas, our dedicated TA Ida will be on hand to provide guidance, insights, and that extra boost of inspiration. It's the perfect opportunity to level up your skills and get a fresh perspective on your project. 

Join us every Tuesday until the end of the semester! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
